Version history

### 1.7
- Rewritten indexing to take FDR into account - An FDR cutoff is supplied in the pepID object and most methods have a FDR argument along with outlier.rm to manage FDR filtering
- Rewritten filtering to match above
- Added plotDetection to show quality of ID
- Tuning of parametersets
- Solved bug requiring that at least one mix sample was selected
- Solved bug requiring the strict use of useML=TRUE in createComplist
- Fixed bug that would erroneous warn about datafile mismatch when using cache=TRUE in createComplist
- Added result cache for each file in collateMSGFplus

### 1.6
- Added mixReport to create a PCA plot showing the position of master mixes

### 1.5
- Added support for MSGF+ along MassAI and Crossworks. MSGF+ is packed together with pepmaps
- Standardized peplist format across all ID algorithms
- Added chromatograms slot to Complist. This is filled the first time getChrom is called
- Added updateComplist to update old versions of Complist objects to the most recent version
- Added modelCaret and predictCaret to allow a tap into the model database of caret
- Added two filtering methods; filterNZV and filterCor from caret
- Better support for UNIX systems
- Added evalPar to evaluate the choice of parameter set without running createComplist
- Added sort argument to editSampleinfo to make it merge the data by common column
- The package now has a namespace file
- Added sampleNames function to get sample names
- Added plotMDS
- Major optimization/rewrite of a range of function + better in-code documentation
- Added peakReport (former plotPeak), intensityReport (former getIntensity), pcaReport and chromReport. pepReport is now a wrapper for all these
- plotPeak rewritten to plotEIC and now supports Features in addition to Peptides
- Now writes xlsx files instead of csv files
- plotChromatogram now has an nPeptides argument to specify the number of highest peptides in the plotting region to be marked
- plotChromatogram now has a colour argument to colour the chromatograms based on the sample info
- createComplist now saves a cache of the MSGF+ analysis in case an error occurs in the later part - this can be loaded with cache=TRUE in createComplist()
- Added plotSample to plot a comprehensive overview of single samples and sampleReport to create a pdf for all samples in a set
- Added plotCoverage to plot the coverage of of the proteins in the database, and coverageReport to create plots for all samples. coverageReport is now included in pepReport
- ggHeat now supports indefinite subgrouping in both columns and rows.
- plotHeat now has a sample.name argument to replace the sample names with a value from the design matrix
- Fixed a bug where non-deleted caches from MSGFplus would prevent subsequent MSGFplus runs...
- Updated the ID step to use MS-GF+ instead of MS-GFDB
- Removed zlib compresion for faster data access

### 1.4
- Added plotHeat functionality to produce transcriptome-like heatmaps
- Added ggplot2 fix for axes label alignment
- bug fix in getFeature. Do not get error when no match is found
- Added several getter functions for Complist and PepID (getRaw, getPeakinfo, getPeplist, getBestmatch, getRawID, getMatch)
- Added switch to suppress retention time correction in createComplist
- Added editPar to change parameters to reflect new analyses
- Added several recalculation functions (reRTcorrect, reGroup, reAnnotate, reMatch, reFindPeaks)
- Changed the internals of the parameters object
- Added new plotting functions: plotChromatogram and plotRetcor
- Incorporated max score in Peplist and use this for Bestmatch

### 1.3
- Added QC module
- Added convertData function that uses msconvert to convert .d to the needed formats.
- Support for MassAI moved to version b0.105. Results from earlier versions now incompatible...
