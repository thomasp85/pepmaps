### Ideas and extensions

- Implementation of peptide analysis functions
- integration of rdisop package for compound ID
- Function to add, edit and delete parameter sets
- investigate calibration results
- add subset possibility to functions
- Stacked area plot for time series data analysis
- function to extract all info on a peptide (like getFeature)
- Subsetting in sampleInfo() and sampleNames()
- implement filehash to overcome memory limitations...
- Make class for RawID and let it define extraction... (and make appropriate changes to plotEIC, getPeplist and getRawID)
- Solve memory problem in filterCor (make the function only calculate it for matched features)
- Calculate correct limit for DmodX

- Ensure consistent argument naming scheme
- Allow for unconstrained subgrouping in ggHeat and apply to rows as well
- test out caret implementation...
